## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Tailwindcss, there are still some features I haven't applied to my projects, but I hope to work with it. 

### Continued development

I'd like to learn React, but I think I should keep going through Javascript first. Tailwind's getting to me, so I'm gonna keep working on this framework, too.
I should strengthen my knowledge in media queries, flexbox and position, i think.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Accordion component](https://tailwind-elements.com/docs/standard/components/accordion/) - I used a component made in Tailwindcss.
- [Flex Direction](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction) - I went deep into Flexbox with Tailwind.
